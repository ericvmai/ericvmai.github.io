# [Eric Mai]{.gradient-text}
## (*Pronounced: "My"*)

**Policy Leader & Researcher**  
*Housing & Community Development*

I'm an experienced nonprofit leader with a background in history, urban planning, and community revitalization. For over five years, I have helped to increase knowledge and data accessibility around affordable housing, led growth and modernization at a policy and research nonprofit, and built relationships with non-traditional partners outside the housing industry.

I have a strong foundation in qualitative and quantitative data analysis and research design. More than anything, I believe in breaking down the barriers that prevent us from understanding complex topics by focusing heavily on data visualization, accessible language, and meeting people where they are. 

I enjoy not just thinking about the work, but also *how* the work is done. Whether exploring ways to making work more efficient or creating systems that increase accountability and transparency, I believe that structure can lead to more flexibility and room for creativity.
