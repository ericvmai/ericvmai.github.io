But my diverse experiences have given me a unique perspective and skills to address any problem with passion and determination.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing up in Newport News, Virginia, I had early dreams of being a photographer for touring bands, documenting their lifestyle and going along for the ride. By taking risks, I was able to go on two national tours to see the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile I had many opportunities to grow in the music industry, I felt a pull towards expanding my knowledge and professional opportunities. After a break from undergrad, I went back with a drive and passion for history. I finished my bachelor’s degree in art history after spending a month in the Middle East doing archaeology.\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon graduation in 2012, I ended up at a cultural resources management firm doing archaeology across the Mid-Atlantic. Digging up layers of history throughout Virginia exposed me to Virginia’s expansive geography and culture. I was all in on archaeology at the time and decided to pursue a master’s degree in archaeology while working in the field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious\n\n\nNext\n\n\nMy education in archaeology and heritage management exposed me to critical theory and a greater understanding of the contemporary impacts of control over historic narratives and resources. This increased consciousness illuminated the ways in which my employer was being unethical in our work.\nI left the field of archaeology seeking to have a greater impact on existing communities and to bring a historic perspective to current development. Of all things, I decided to make a big pivot and go back to school to get another master’s degree.\nIn 2018, I went all in on urban planning at Virginia Commonwealth University. The program helped shape and develop my interest in housing and community development. After graduating in 2020 (during the pandemic), I landed a position with a consulting firm called HDAdvisors. For just over five years, I was exposed to Virginia’s affordable housing industry and helped to elevate zoning education, increase capacity among partners to solve their housing challenges, and brought innovative ideas to Virginia leaders."
