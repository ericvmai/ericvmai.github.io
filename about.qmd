## Background

Touring with bands. Digging up history. Leading policy and developing affordable housing. The path to where I am now has been long and winding with lots of detours. But my diverse experiences have given me a unique perspective and skills to address any problem with passion and determination.

Growing up in Newport News, Virginia, I had early dreams of being a photographer for touring bands, documenting their lifestyle and going along for the ride. By taking risks, I was able to go on two national tours to see the United States.

While I had many opportunities to grow in the music industry, I felt a pull towards expanding my knowledge and professional opportunities. After a break from undergrad, I went back with a drive and passion for history. I finished my bachelor's degree in art history after spending a month in the Middle East doing archaeology.

Upon graduation in 2012, I ended up at a cultural resources management firm doing archaeology across the Mid-Atlantic. Digging up layers of history throughout Virginia exposed me to Virginia's expansive geography and culture. I was all in on archaeology at the time and decided to pursue a master's degree in archaeology while working in the field.

My education in archaeology and heritage management exposed me to critical theory and a greater understanding of the contemporary impacts of control over historic narratives and resources. This increased consciousness illuminated the ways in which my employer was being unethical in our work.

I left the field of archaeology seeking to have a greater impact on existing communities and to bring a historic perspective to current development. Of all things, I decided to make a big pivot and go back to school to get another master's degree.

In 2018, I went all in on urban planning at Virginia Commonwealth University. The program helped shape and develop my interest in housing and community development. After graduating in 2020 (during the pandemic), I landed a position with a consulting firm called HDAdvisors. For just over five years, I was exposed to Virginia's affordable housing industry and helped to elevate zoning education, increase capacity among partners to solve their housing challenges, and brought innovative ideas to Virginia leaders.
