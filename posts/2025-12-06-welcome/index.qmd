Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my thoughts and insights, not just on housing policy, but other issues and areas of interest for me.

## What to Expect

This blog will feature:

- **Housing Policy Analysis**: Deep dives into housing research, policy proposals, and data analysis
- **Data Insights**: Visualizations and findings from various datasets
- **Professional Updates**: Thoughts on my work and career journey
- **Random Musings**: Anything else that catches my interest
